# Advanced search

ReelRadio's search bar (named FINDIT), searches for exhibits by title.
When our team took on the project, we proposed the idea of being able to search all of the text on the site as well as the exhibit title.
There are thousands of exhibit descriptions and radio DJ biographies that contain text that is not searchable using the existing FINDIT.
In addition to this, our team proposed running the exhibits through a speech-to-text transcription service to generate text files of the spoken word in the broadcasts themselves.

So, with the addition of the ability to search the text on the site, and the ability to search what the radio broadcasts are saying, the new "Advanced Search" page is a lot more useful than before.
We made sure to keep the existing behavior of exhibit title search when implementing the new search features.
